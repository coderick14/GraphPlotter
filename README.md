###Web Application to display graphs visually
####This will draw the graph, show the traversal orders for DFS and BFS, and also draw the MST(if it exists)

+ Clone the repository.  
`git clone https://github.com/coderick14/GraphPlotter.git`  
+ Run graph.html
  + Enter the number of nodes and edges.
  + Click on **Submit**.
  + Enter the initial and terminal vertices and the weights for the edges.
  + Select the starting node for Breadth-First Search.
  + Once you are done entering the data for all the edges, you will get to see the graph.
